#!Approximate Pattern Matching Problem

* We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches if 
* there is some k-mer substring Pattern' of Text having d or fewer mismatches with Pattern, 
*   HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern') â‰¤ d. 
* @example 
    #! ATTCTGGA
    #! CGCCCGAATCCAGAACGCATTCCCATATTTCGGGACCACTGGCCTCCACGGTACGGACGTCAATCAAATGCCTAGCGGCTTGTGGTTTCTCCTACGCTCC
    #! 3
* returns 
    #! 6 7 26 27 78.

#? Find all approximate occurrences of a pattern in a string.

* Given: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d.
* Return: All  starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches.
